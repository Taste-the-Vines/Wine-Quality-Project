# Wine-Quality-Project

## Project Description
#### Data pulled from Data.world. The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Number of wines representing datapoints: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. 11 features were utilized (reference: (https://data.world/food/wine-quality)).

## Goals 
  * Analyze wine composition data and the 3-9 quality classification
  * Establish a baseline classification for wine target value
  * Generate a model that beats the baseline in acuracy

## Initial Hypothesis
###

## Project Plan
 * Acquisition
   * two datasets on Red and White wine pulled from Data.world
 * Preparation 
   * two data sets merged 
   * checked for nulls (there were none)
   * created column for color of wine (see data dictionary)
   * outliers removed
   * data split into Train, Validate, and Test sets
 * Exploration
   * vizualizaitons 
   * bivariate stats analysis
   * see below
* Feature Engineering
  * dummies created
  * clustering experimented with (see below)
##  Exploration
### Exploration Question 1:
* Is the average alcohol content in low quality wine significantly lower than the alcohol content in high quality wine?
  -  ùêª0
   : There is no difference the average alcohol content between wines with a quality of less than 5 and wines with a quality greater than 7
  -  ùêªùëé
   : The average alcohol content of wines with a quality less than 6 is significantlly lower than the average alcohol content of wines with a quality greater than 6
### Exploration Question 2:
* Is the average chloride in high quality wine significantly lower than the average chloride for all wines?
  -  ùêª0
   : There is no difference the average chloride in wines with a quality greater than 6 and the average chloride in all wines
  -  ùêªùëé
   : The average chloride of wines with a quality greater than 6 is significantlly lower than the average chloride of all wines
### Exploration Question 3:
* Is the average citric acid in low quality wine significantly lower than the average citric acid in high quality wines?
-  ùêª0
 : There is no difference the average citric acid in wines with quality lower than 6 and the average citric acid in wines with quality greater than 6
-  ùêªùëé
 : The average citric acid of wines with quality lower than 6 is significantlly lower than the average citric acid of wines with quality greater than 6
 ### Exploration Question 4:
*Is the average pH in low quality wine significantly lower than the average pH in high quality wines?
-  ùêª0
 : There is no difference the average pH in wines with quality lower than 6 and the average pH in wines with quality greater than 6
-  ùêªùëé
 : The average pH of wines with quality lower than 6 is significantlly lower than the average pH of wines with quality greater than 6

## Preparation
### * see prepare.py for notations and information on further disposition of data during and after acquisition
## Modeling
  * Models used for Train and Validation
  * Random Forest iterations (best selected)


## Data Dictionary
| Feature | Description |
| ------ | ----|
| fixed acidity | most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)   |
| volatile acidity | the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste (acetic acid - g / dm^3) |
| citric acid | found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‚Äòfreshness‚Äô and flavor to wines (g / dm^3) |
 | residual sugar | the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it‚Äôs rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet (g / dm^3) |
| chlorides | the amount of salt in the wine (sodium chloride - g / dm^3) |
| free sulfur dioxide | the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine (mg / dm^3) |
| total sulfur dioxide | amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine (mg / dm^3) |
| density | the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content (g / cm^3) |
| pH | describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale |
| sulphates | a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant (potassium sulphate - g / dm3) |
| alcohol | the percent alcohol content of the wine (% by volume) |
| color | color of the wine (red or white) |
| quality | rated by sensory observation of expert (score between 0 and 10) TARGET VALUE |
